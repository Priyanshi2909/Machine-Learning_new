Project Description

Congratulations! You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!

Features
It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

Target 

Yearly Amount Spent

Conclusion

Interpreting the coefficients:
Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of 25.98 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on App is associated with an increase of 38.59 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on Website is associated with an increase of 0.19 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Length of Membership is associated with an increase of 61.27 total dollars spent.

It seems developing the app is more beneficial, but the Length of Membership for the app/website might have to be considered since Length of Membership and Yearly amount spent is directly correlated
